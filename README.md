# Meteor Crypto Project

The app for bitches.
This demo demonstrates a test for login into a system to create contracts either for dev or for rev.

Learn how to build this app by following the [Meteor Tutorial](http://www.meteor.com/install).

Read more about building apps with Meteor in the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com).

# Artefacts
1. Install meteor. Maybe you need to install some additional NPM packages.
2. test if installation worked out well. Just type in meteor.
3. switch to project root folder and type in meteor


# Repo hygiene
- use develop branch for any kind of development
- work with feature branches and don't push directly to development branch
- master is for the master bitch only and later for production.

#ToDos
- better readme
- load real contract and show contract data
... a lot more stuff too late for bitches...
